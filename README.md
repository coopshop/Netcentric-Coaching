# Coaching
Coaching process at __Netcentric__ conducted by [Erik Grijzen](https://github.com/ErikGrijzen)

This coaching process will allow me to focus on understanding by doing the very foundations of the front-end development process without the limitations of an specific backend system. The final goal is to build from scratch a frontend application using state of the art frameworks and techonolgies with a building process to automate all the steps to get the final release for the production environment. 

The whole process is divided in three parts:

1. __Improve project setup knowledge__
  * How to setup a project on [Github] (https://github.com/davidlampon/coaching).
  * How to setup the [HTML5 Boilerplate] (https://html5boilerplate.com/).
  * How to setup the project folder structure.
  * How to develop plain html and css without preprocessors from the [Do] (http://www.invisionapp.com/do) psd design for the todo app.
  
  Target:
  > Implement html pages in plain html5 and css3 using HTML5 Boilerplate as base template that will become the different views of the MVC todo list application using Github as a repository. My coach will review that all the topics are correctly implemented and checked as completed.

2. __Improve automation build knowledge__

  a. How to improve the working process.
    * Improvements in terminal messaging and readability.
    * Implementing static code and code style analysis with [ESLint] (http://eslint.org/) ([JSCS] (http://jscs.info/) + [JSHint] (http://jshint.com/)).
    * Live reload with [BrowserSync] (http://www.browsersync.io/).
    
  b. How to improve the application build process.
    * Development and production build.
    * CSS pre processor compilation, exploring SASS competitors as [PostCSS] (https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and [LibSass] (http://libsass.org/).
    * Minification and concatenation. 
    * Testing with [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io/).
    
  Target:
  > Develop a fast and stable build process which automates the necessary steps to release the application in a production environment. My coach will review that all the topics are correctly implemented and checked as completed.

3. __Improve client application architecture knowledge__
  * How to create a simple single page MVC todo list application with [Angular 2] (https://angular.io/).
  * How to manage all the dependencies of the project with [NPM] (https://www.npmjs.com/).
  * How to use routing to change the view.
  * How to work with public APIs retrieving information in JSON format to present dynamic information.

 Target:
  > Create a todo list application from scratch using the Angular 2 framework, that will be able to do all CRUD actions. This application has to be a SPA and change its views using routing without refreshing the page. It will retrieve all its data using AJAX that is connected to a REST API from a public source. My coach will review that all the topics are correctly implemented and checked as completed.
